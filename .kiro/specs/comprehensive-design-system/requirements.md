# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive design system for the medicine delivery platform, focusing on color theory, depth creation through shadows, and visual hierarchy. The system will provide a cohesive visual language that enhances user experience while maintaining accessibility and brand consistency across the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Color System Foundation

**User Story:** As a designer/developer, I want a scientifically-based color system using HSL format, so that I can create consistent and intuitive color palettes with proper contrast ratios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating color palettes THEN the system SHALL use HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) format as the primary color definition method
2. WHEN defining neutral colors THEN the system SHALL set saturation to 0% and vary lightness values to create grayscale shades
3. WHEN creating brand colors THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent hue and saturation while varying lightness for different shades
4. WHEN implementing dark mode THEN the system SHALL provide complementary lightness values (100 - light mode value) for seamless theme switching
5. WHEN defining color variables THEN the system SHALL use semantic naming conventions that remain relevant across light and dark modes

### Requirement 2: Depth and Visual Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want UI elements to have visual depth and clear hierarchy, so that I can easily understand the interface structure and focus on important elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying UI cards THEN the system SHALL apply layered shadows with small top highlights and darker bottom shadows
2. WHEN creating elevated elements THEN the system SHALL use lighter background shades overlaid on base colors to simulate depth
3. WHEN implementing hover states THEN the system SHALL increase shadow intensity to provide visual feedback
4. WHEN designing navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use color layering with varying lightness values to create depth
5. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual states (default, hover, active, disabled)

### Requirement 3: Semantic Color Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want colors to convey meaning consistently throughout the app, so that I can quickly understand the status and importance of different elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying success states THEN the system SHALL use medical green (hue: 145°) with appropriate lightness variations
2. WHEN showing warnings THEN the system SHALL use medical amber (hue: 45°) with sufficient contrast for accessibility
3. WHEN indicating errors THEN the system SHALL use medical red (hue: 0°) with high visibility and proper contrast
4. WHEN providing information THEN the system SHALL use light blue (hue: 200°) that complements the primary brand colors
5. WHEN displaying primary actions THEN the system SHALL use the medical blue brand color (hue: 210°) consistently

### Requirement 4: Accessibility and Contrast

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want sufficient color contrast and alternative indicators, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text on backgrounds THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN using color to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide additional visual indicators (icons, patterns, typography)
3. WHEN implementing focus states THEN the system SHALL provide high-contrast focus indicators that are clearly visible
4. WHEN creating color combinations THEN the system SHALL test accessibility across both light and dark modes
5. WHEN designing for colorblind users THEN the system SHALL ensure information is conveyed through means other than color alone

### Requirement 5: Brand Consistency and Medical Context

**User Story:** As a user of a medical app, I want the visual design to convey trust, professionalism, and safety, so that I feel confident using the platform for my healthcare needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying brand colors THEN the system SHALL use medical blue (hue: 210°) as the primary brand color with 75% saturation
2. WHEN creating secondary colors THEN the system SHALL use medical teal (hue: 160°) to complement the primary brand
3. WHEN designing emergency or critical elements THEN the system SHALL use high-contrast emergency red with appropriate visual weight
4. WHEN displaying safety or success elements THEN the system SHALL use medical green that conveys health and safety
5. WHEN maintaining brand consistency THEN the system SHALL apply colors uniformly across all screens and components

### Requirement 6: Implementation and Tooling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy-to-use color tokens and CSS variables, so that I can implement the design system efficiently and maintain consistency across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing colors in code THEN the system SHALL provide CSS custom properties for all color values
2. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL support JavaScript-based theme toggling and CSS media query detection
3. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL provide semantic color tokens that abstract specific color values
4. WHEN maintaining the system THEN the system SHALL allow real-time color adjustments through HSL parameter manipulation
5. WHEN documenting colors THEN the system SHALL provide clear naming conventions and usage guidelines for developers

### Requirement 7: Advanced Color Formats Support

**User Story:** As a designer working with modern tools, I want support for advanced color formats like OKLCH, so that I can achieve more accurate color reproduction and better perceptual uniformity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining colors THEN the system SHALL support both HSL and OKLCH color formats for maximum compatibility
2. WHEN creating color variations THEN the system SHALL maintain perceptual uniformity across different lightness levels
3. WHEN implementing gradients THEN the system SHALL use color formats that provide smooth transitions
4. WHEN working with design tools THEN the system SHALL provide color values compatible with modern design software
5. WHEN future-proofing the system THEN the system SHALL be structured to easily adopt new color format standards

### Requirement 8: Component-Specific Color Applications

**User Story:** As a user interacting with different UI components, I want consistent color application that enhances usability, so that I can navigate and use the interface intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying form elements THEN the system SHALL use consistent color states for validation, focus, and interaction
2. WHEN showing navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear active, inactive, and hover states using color and depth
3. WHEN implementing buttons THEN the system SHALL use primary colors for main actions and secondary colors for alternative actions
4. WHEN creating data visualizations THEN the system SHALL use color palettes that are accessible and meaningful in medical contexts
5. WHEN designing loading and progress indicators THEN the system SHALL use colors that indicate system status clearly
